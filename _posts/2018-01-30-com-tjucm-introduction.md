# About TJ UCM

UCM stands for Universal Content Manager. It is a most useful & flexible joomla extension.

To create a manual form without UCM, we need to start from scratch which can be  cumbersome, needs more time. TJUCM provides easier solution for creating forms & field control with less or no code required & it also allow saving drafts in steps.

It uses TJFields for field management.
